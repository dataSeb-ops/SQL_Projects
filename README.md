# SQL Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I’ve completed to demonstrate proficiency in SQL.  
Each project is based on real-world datasets and highlights specific SQL skills such as string manipulation, date parsing, joins, aggregations, and exploratory analysis.

## About

This repo is a portfolio showcase of my SQL skills, demonstrating:  
- Cleaning messy real-world datasets  
- Building reusable queries and views  
- Analyzing data to extract meaningful insights  
- Documenting processes for both technical and non-technical audiences

## Projects

### [Tech Layoffs Analysis (2022–2023)](./tech_layoffs_research)
**Dataset Sources:**  
- [Technology Company Layoffs 2022–2023 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salimwid/technology-company-layoffs-20222023-data)  
- [SOFR Interest Rate Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SOFR)  

**Description:**  
Analyzed layoff trends across cities, months, and quarters, and compared layoffs to interest rate changes over time.  
Also explored differences between layoffs in private vs. public companies.  

**Skills Highlighted:**  
- String cleaning (`REPLACE`, `SUBSTR`, `TRIM`)  
- Date parsing (handling `M/D/YYYY` formats)  
- Aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)  
- Combining external datasets (joining layoffs with SOFR interest rate data)  

**Key Findings:**  
- Layoffs were concentrated in major tech hubs like San Francisco and New York.  
- Layoffs peaked in late 2022, coinciding with rising interest rates.  
- Public companies tended to report larger absolute layoffs.

## Tools Used
- **SQLite / DB Browser for SQLite** for query execution and database management  
- **Excel** for exporting and visualizing results  
- **GitHub** for version control and project documentation
